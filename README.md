# Data operator


This program is not perfect, but this code was written by me and my friend at a time when we had just finished learning the basics of Python. So, don't judge harshly)



## Installation

In order for this program to work, you have to install the "phonenumbers" module on your pc


#### For windos :

Open Comand Prompt and enter: 
```bash
  pip install phonenumbers
```


#### For macOS :
Open Mac Terminal and enter: 
```bash
  pip3 install phonenumbers
```

### That is all!

Now execute the main program (Data Operator) and you can work.
